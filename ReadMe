This is a project for fun using flask
The goal is to be able to integrate some sort of Golang into it (probably using it to call services) as I'm learning Go

In order to use this script, you need to have flask and mysql installed


For MacOS:

To install flask
```
pip install flask
```

To start flask service
```
FLASK_APP=flask_main.py flask run
```

To install MySQL:
```
brew install mysql
```
My version is on 5.6

The config uses barebone setup with localhost and root as user. Change accordingly.

To start mysqlservice:
```
brew services start mysql
```
